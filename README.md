# Bakground_Removal
Project : remove background from image

# ðŸ§¼ Background Removal Web App using UÂ²-Net (Flask + PyTorch)

This is a simple web application built with Flask that allows users to upload an image and get the background removed using a lightweight UÂ²-Net (`u2netp`) deep learning model.
# Steps to use the repository

---
## Step 1: ðŸ“¥ Download U-2-Net Folder

To download the `U-2-Net` folder (without model weights):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xuebinqin/U-2-Net.git
```
## Step 2: Download Pretrained Model (u2netp.pth): 
After downloading 'u2netp.pth' move it in side 'U-2-Net folder'. 

## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload any image through a web interface
- Processes image with UÂ²-Net model (lightweight `u2netp`)
- Outputs transparent PNG with background removed
- Clean and colorful UI with light blue and violet tones

## ðŸ§  Model Info

We use the **UÂ²-Net** architecture from the paper:  
> [UÂ²-Net: Going Deeper with Nested U-Structure for Salient Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09007)

This project uses the smaller version: `u2netp.pth` (~4.7MB) which is fast and lightweight for background removal.
